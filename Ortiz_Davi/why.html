  <center> <h1> Why This Game</h1></center> 
  <P> I chose this set up because ( i obviusly like gambling ... joking!... kinda...) <br> In this gambling simulator(...mhmcht), you play against a computer that feels human, but the odds aren’t in your favor. I designed it to reflect how machines are often built to outperform people, even in spaces that feel fair or random. </P>
