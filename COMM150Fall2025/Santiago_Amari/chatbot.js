Perhaps more faithful as blasphemy is faithful, than as reverent worship and identifica- tion. Blasphemy has always seemed to require taking things very seriously. I know no better stance to adopt from within the secular-religious, evangelical traditions of United States poli- tics, including the politics of socialist-feminism. Blasphemy protects one from the moral majority within, while still insist- ing on the need for community. Blasphemy is not apostasy. Irony is about contradictions that do not resolve into larger wholes, even dialectically, about the tension of holding incom- patible things together because both or all are necessary and true. Irony is about humor and serious play. It is also a rhetorical strategy and a political method, one I would like to see more honored within socialist-feminism. At the center of my ironic faith, my blasphemy, is the image of the cyborg. A cyborg is a cybernetic organism, a hybrid of machine and organism, a creature of social reality as well as a creature of fic- tion.

The interna- tional women’s movements have constructed “women’s expe- rience,” as well as uncovered or discovered this crucial collec- tive object. This experience is a fiction and fact of the most crucial, political kind. Liberation rests on the construction of the consciousness, the imaginative apprehension, of oppres- sion, and so of possibility. The cyborg is a matter of fiction and lived experience that changes what counts as women’s experi- ence in the late twentieth century. This is a struggle over life and death, but the boundary between science fiction and social re- ality is an optical illusion. Contemporary science fiction is full of cyborgs—creatures simultaneously animal and machine, who populate worlds am- biguously natural and crafted. Modern medicine is also full of cyborgs, of couplings between organism and machine, each conceived as coded devices, in an intimacy and with a power that were not generated in the history of sexuality. Cyborg “sex” restores some of the lovely replicative baroque of ferns and invertebrates (such nice organic prophylactics against hetero- sexism). Cyborg replication is uncoupled from organic repro- duction. Modem production seems like a dream of cyborg col- onization work, a dream that makes the nightmare of Taylorism seem idyllic. And modern war is a cyborg orgy, coded by C3 I, command-control -communication-intelligence, an $84 bil - lion item in 1984’s U.S. defense budget.

By the late twentieth century, our time, a mythic time, we are all chimeras, theorized and fabricated hybrids of machine and organism—in short, cyborgs. The cyborg is our ontology; it gives us our politics. The cyborg is a condensed image of both imagination and material reality, the two joined centers struc- turing any possibility of historical transformation. In the tradi- tions of “Western” science and politics—the tradition of racist, male-dominant capitalism; the tradition of progress; the tradi- tion of the appropriation of nature as resource for the produc- tions of culture; the tradition of reproduction of the self from the reflections of the other—the relation between organism and machine has been a border war. The stakes in the border war have been the territories of production, reproduction, and imagination. This essay is an argument for pleasure in the con- fusion of boundaries and for responsibility in their construc- tion. It is also an effort to contribute to socialist-feminist cul- ture and theory in a postmodernist, non-naturalist mode and in the utopian tradition of imagining a world without gender, which is perhaps a world without genesis, but maybe also a world without end. The cyborg incarnation is outside salvation history. Nor does it mark time on an oedipal calendar, attempt- ing to heal the terrible cleavages of gender in an oral symbiotic utopia or post-oedipal apocalypse.

All rights reserved. unpublished manuscript on Jacques Lacan, Melanie Klein, and nuclear culture, “Lacklein,” the most terrible and perhaps the most promising monsters in cyborg worlds are embodied in non-oedipal narratives with a different logic of repression, which we need to understand for our survival. 1 The cyborg is a creature in a postgender world; it has no truck with bisexuality, pre-oedipal symbiosis, unalienated labor, or other seductions to organic wholeness through a final appropri- ation of all the powers of the parts into a higher unity. In a sense, the cyborg has no origin story in the Western sense—a “final” irony since the cyborg is also the awful apocalyptic telos of the “West’s” escalating dominations of abstract individuation, an ultimate self untied at last from all dependency, a man in space. An origin story in the “Western,” humanist sense depends on the myth of original unity, fullness, bliss and terror, represented by the phallic mother from whom all humans must separate, the task of individual development and of history, the twin potent myths inscribed most powerfully for us in psychoanalysis and Marxism. Hilary Klein has argued that both Marxism and psy- choanalysis, in their concepts of labor and of individuation and gender formation, depend on the plot of original unity out of which difference must be produced and enlisted in a drama of escalating domination of woman/nature.2 The cyborg skips the step of original unity, of identification with nature in the West- ern sense. This is its illegitimate promise that might lead to sub- version of its teleology as Star Wars. A Cyborg Manifesto 8 Haraway, Donna J.. Manifestly Haraway, University of Minnesota Press, 2016.

No longer structured by the polar- ity of public and private, the cyborg defines a technological polis based partly on a revolution of social relations in the oikos, the household. Nature and culture are reworked; the one can no longer be the resource for appropriation or incorporation by the other. The relationships for forming wholes from parts, including those of polarity and hierarchical domination, are at issue in the cyborg world. Unlike the hopes of Franken- stein’s monster, the cyborg does not expect its father to save it through a restoration of the garden—that is, through the fabri- cation of a heterosexual mate, through its completion in a fin- ished whole, a city and cosmos. The cyborg does not dream of community on the model of the organic family, this time with- out the oedipal project. The cyborg would not recognize the Garden of Eden; it is not made of mud and cannot dream of re- turning to dust. Perhaps that is why I want to see if cyborgs can subvert the apocalypse of returning to nuclear dust in the manic compulsion to name the Enemy. Cyborgs are not rever- ent; they do not re-member the cosmos.

There is much room for radical political people to con- test the meanings of the breached boundary. 3 The cyborg ap- pears in myth precisely where the boundary between human and animal is transgressed. Far from signaling a walling off of people from other living beings, cyborgs signal disturbingly and pleasur ably tight coupling. Bestiality has a new status in this cycle of marriage exchange. The second leaky distinction is between animal–human (organism) and machine. Pre-cybernetic machines could be haunted; there was always the specter of the ghost in the ma- chine. This dualism structured the dialogue between material- ism and idealism that was settled by a dialectical progeny, called spirit or history, according to taste. But basically machines were not self-moving, self-designing, autonomous. They could not achieve man’s dream, only mock it. They were not man, an au- thor to himself, but only a caricature of that masculinist repro- ductive dream. To think they were otherwise was paranoid. Now we are not so sure. Late twentieth-century machines have made thoroughly ambiguous the difference between natural and artificial, mind and body, self-developing and externally designed, and many other distinctions that used to apply to or- ganisms and machines. Our machines are disturbingly lively, and we ourselves frighteningly inert. Technological determination is only one ideological space opened up by the reconceptions of machine and organism as coded texts through which we engage in the play of writing and A Cyborg Manifesto 11 Haraway, Donna J..

Ultimately the “hardest” science is about the realm of greatest boundary confusion, the realm of pure number, pure spirit, C3 I, cryptography, and the preservation of potent se- crets. The new machines are so clean and light. Their engineers are sun-worshippers mediating a new scientific revolution as- sociated with the night dream of postindustrial society. The diseases evoked by these clean machines are “no more” than the minuscule coding changes of an antigen in the immune system, “no more” than the experience of stress.

There might be a cyborg Alice taking account of these new dimensions. Ironically, it might be the unnatural cyborg women making chips in Asia and spiral dancing in Santa Rita Jail8 whose constructed unities will guide effective opposi- tional strategies. So my cyborg myth is about transgressed boundaries, potent fusions, and dangerous possibilities, which progressive people might explore as one part of needed political work. One of my premises is that most American socialists and feminists see deepened dualisms of mind and body, animal and machine, idealism and materialism in the social practices, symbolic for- mula tions, and physical artifacts associated with “high tech- nology” and scientific culture.

Painful frag - mentation among feminists (not to mention among women) along every possible fault line has made the concept of woman elusive, an excuse for the matrix of women’s dominations of each other. For me— and for many who share a similar historical location in white, professional middle-class, female, radical, North American, mid-adult bodies— the sources of a crisis in political identity are legion. The recent history for much of the U.S. left and U.S. feminism has been a response to this kind of crisis by endless splitting and searches for a new essential unity. But there has also been a growing recognition of another re- sponse through coalition—affinity, not identity.10 Chela Sandoval (n.d.; 1984), from a consideration of specific historical moments in the formation of the new political voice called women of color, has theorized a hopeful model of political identity called “oppositional consciousness,” born of the skills for reading webs of power by those refused stable membership in the social categories of race, sex, or class. Women of color, a name contested at its origins by those whom it would incorpo- rate, as well as a historical consciousness marking systematic breakdown of all the signs of Man in “Western” traditions, con- structs a kind of postmodernist identity out of otherness, dif- ference, and specificity. This postmodernist identity is fully political, whatever might be said about other possible postmod- A Cyborg Manifesto 17 Haraway, Donna J.. Manifestly Haraway, University of Minnesota Press, 2016.

All rights reserved. ernisms. Sandoval’s oppositional consciousness is about con- tradictory locations and heterochronic calendars, not about relativisms and pluralisms. Sandoval emphasizes the lack of any essential criterion for identifying who is a woman of color. She notes that the defini- tion of the group has been by conscious appropriation of nega- tion. For example, a Chicana or U.S. black woman has not been able to speak as a woman or as a black person or as a Chicano. Thus, she was at the bottom of a cascade of negative identi- ties, left out of even the privileged oppressed authorial cate- gories called “women and blacks,” who claimed to make the important revolutions. The category “woman” negated all non- white women; “black” negated all nonblack people, as well as all black women. But there was also no “she,” no singularity, but a sea of differences among U.S. women who have affirmed their historical identity as U.S. women of color. This identity marks out a self-consciously constructed space that cannot affirm the capacity to act on the basis of natural identification, but only on the basis of conscious coalition, of affinity, of political kinship.11 Unlike the “woman” of some streams of the white women’s movement in the United States, there is no naturalization of the matrix, or at least this is what Sandoval argues is uniquely avail- able through the power of oppositional consciousness. Sandoval’s argument has to be seen as one potent for mu - lation for feminists out of the worldwide development of an - ticolonialist discourse; that is to say, discourse dissolving the A Cyborg Manifesto 18 Haraway, Donna J..

As orientalism is deconstructed politically and semi - otically, the identities of the occident destabilize, including those of feminists . 12 Sandoval argues that “women of color” have a chance to build an effective unity that does not replicate the imperializing, totalizing revolutionary subjects of previous Marx isms and feminisms, which had not faced the conse- quences of the disorderly polyphony emerging from decolo- nization. Katie King has emphasized the limits of identification and the political/poetic mechanics of identification built into read- ing “the poem,” that generative core of cultural feminism. King criticizes the persistent tendency among contemporary femi- nists from different “moments” or “conversations” in feminist practice to taxonomize the women’s movement to make one’s own political tendencies appear to be the telos of the whole. These taxonomies tend to remake feminist history so that it ap- pears to be an ideological struggle among coherent types per- sisting over time, especially those typical units called radical, liberal, and socialist-feminism. Literally, all other feminisms are either incorporated or marginalized, usually by building an explicit ontology and epistemology.13 Taxonomies of femi- nism produce epistemologies to police deviation from official women’s experience. And of course, “women’s culture,” like women of color, is consciously created by mechanisms induc- A Cyborg Manifesto 19 Haraway, Donna J.. Manifestly Haraway, University of Minnesota Press, 2016.

The politics of race and culture in the U.S. women’s movements are intimately in- terwoven.

Both Marxist/socialist-feminisms and radical feminisms have simultaneously naturalized and denatured the category “woman” and consciousness of the social lives of “women.” Perhaps a schematic caricature can highlight both kinds of moves. Marxian socialism is rooted in an analysis of wage labor that reveals class structure. The consequence of the wage rela- tionship is systematic alienation, as the worker is dissociated from his (sic) product. Abstraction and illusion rule in knowl- edge, domination rules in practice. Labor is the preeminently privileged category enabling the Marxist to overcome illusion and find that point of view that is necessary for changing the world.

The unity of women here rests on an epistemology based on the ontological struc- ture of “labor.” Marxist/socialist-feminism does not “natural- ize” unity; it is a possible achievement based on a possible standpoint rooted in social relations. The essentializing move is in the ontological structure of labor or of its analogue, women’s activity.14 The inheritance of Marxian humanism, with its pre- eminently Western self, is the difficulty for me. The contribu- tion from these formulations has been the emphasis on the daily responsibility of real women to build unities, rather than to nat- uralize them. Catharine MacKinnon’s (1982, 1987) version of radical fem- inism is itself a caricature of the appropriating, incorporating, totalizing tendencies of Western theories of identity grounding action. 15 It is factually and politically wrong to assimilate all of the diverse “moments” or “conversations” in recent women’s politics named radical feminism to MacKinnon’s version. But the teleological logic of her theory shows how an epistemology and ontology—including their negations—erase or police dif- ference. Only one of the effects of MacKinnon’s theory is the rewriting of the history of the polymorphous field called radical feminism. The major effect is the production of a theory of ex- perience, of women’s identity, that is a kind of apocalypse for all revolutionary standpoints. That is, the totalization built into this tale of radical feminism achieves its end—the unity of A Cyborg Manifesto 23 Haraway, Donna J.. Manifestly Haraway, University of Minnesota Press, 2016.

All rights reserved. women—by enforcing the experience of and testimony to radi- cal nonbeing. As for the Marxist/socialist-feminist, conscious- ness is an achievement, not a natural fact. And MacKinnon’s theory eliminates some of the difficulties built into humanist revolutionary subjects, but at the cost of radical reductionism. MacKinnon argues that feminism necessarily adopted a dif- ferent analytical strategy from Marxism, looking first not at the structure of class but at the structure of sex/gender and its generative relationship, men’s constitution and appropriation of women sexually. Ironically, MacKinnon’s “ontology” con- structs a nonsubject, a nonbeing. Another’s desire, not the self’s labor, is the origin of “woman.” She therefore develops a theory of consciousness that enforces what can count as “women’s” experience—anything that names sexual violation, indeed, sex itself as far as “women” can be concerned. Feminist practice is the construction of this form of consciousness—that is, the self-knowledge of a self-who-is-not. Perversely, sexual appropriation in this feminism still has the epistemological status of labor; that is to say, the point from which an analysis able to contribute to changing the world must flow. But sexual objectification, not alienation, is the conse- quence of the structure of sex/gender. In the realm of knowl- edge, the result of sexual objectification is illusion and ab - straction. However, a woman is not simply alienated from her product but in a deep sense does not exist as a subject, or even potential subject, since she owes her existence as a woman to sexual appropriation.

MacKinnon’s radical theory of experience is totalizing in the extreme; it does not so much marginalize as obliterate the au- thority of any other women’s political speech and action. It is a totalization producing what Western patriarchy itself never succeeded in doing—feminists’ consciousness of the nonexis- tence of women, except as products of men’s desire. I think MacKinnon correctly argues that no Marxian version of iden- tity can firmly ground women’s unity. But in solving the prob- lem of the contradictions of any Western revolutionary subject for feminist purposes, she develops an even more authoritarian doctrine of experience. If my complaint about socialist/Marx- ian standpoints is their unintended erasure of polyvocal, unas- similable, radical difference made visible in anticolonial dis- course and practice, MacKinnon’s intentional erasure of all difference through the device of the “essential” nonexistence of women is not reassuring. In my taxonomy, which like any other taxonomy is a rein- scription of history, radical feminism can accommodate all the activities of women named by socialist-feminists as forms of labor only if the activity can somehow be sexualized. Repro- duction had different tones of meanings for the two tendencies, one rooted in labor, one in sex, both calling the consequences of domination and ignorance of social and personal reality “false consciousness.” Beyond either the difficulties or the contributions in the ar- A Cyborg Manifesto 25 Haraway, Donna J..

World War, along with groups like youth. 16 Her dates are doubt- ful; but we are now accustomed to remembering that as objects of knowledge and as historical actors “race” did not always ex- ist, “class” has a historical genesis, and “homosexuals” are quite junior. It is no accident that the symbolic system of the family of man—and so the essence of woman—breaks up at the same moment that networks of connection among people on the planet are unprecedentedly multiple, pregnant, and com- plex. “Advanced capitalism” is inadequate to convey the struc- ture of this historical moment. In the “Western” sense, the end of man is at stake. It is no accident that woman disintegrates into women in our time. Perhaps socialist-feminists were not substantially guilty of producing essentialist theory that sup- pressed women’s particularity and contradictory interests. I think we have been, at least through unreflective participation in the logics, languages, and practices of white humanism and through searching for a single ground of domination to secure our revolutionary voice. Now we have less excuse. But in the consciousness of our failures, we risk lapsing into boundless difference and giving up on the confusing task of making par- tial, real connection. Some differences are playful; some are poles of world historical systems of domination. “Epistemol- ogy” is about knowing the difference. A Cyborg Manifesto 27 Haraway, Donna J..

T H E I N F O R M A T I C S O F D O M I N A T I O N In this attempt at an epistemological and political position, I would like to sketch a picture of possible unity, a picture in- debted to socialist and feminist principles of design. The frame for my sketch is set by the extent and importance of rearrange- ments in worldwide social relations tied to science and technol- ogy. I argue for a politics rooted in claims about fundamental changes in the nature of class, race, and gender in an emerging system of world order analogous in its novelty and scope to that created by industrial capitalism; we are living through a move- ment from an organic, industrial society to a polymorphous, in- formation system—from all work to all play, a deadly game. Si- multaneously material and ideological, the dichotomies may be expressed in the following chart of transitions from the com- fortable old hierarchical dominations to the scary new networks I have called the informatics of domination: Organics of Domination Informatics of Domination representation >simulation bourgeois novel, realism>science fiction, postmodernism organism >biotic component depth, integrity >surface, boundary heat >noise biology as clinical practice>biology as inscription A Cyborg Manifesto 28 Haraway, Donna J..
