  <h3>Thinking with Donna Haraway</h3>
  <p class="theory-intro">
    Your interaction has traced a boundary between “human” and “machine.”
Donna Haraway’s work shows that such boundaries are not fixed, but
co-produced by the very interfaces that describe them. In this lecture,
Haraway moves from the “cyborg” — the figure that disrupts human/machine —
to the “companion species,” where relations between humans, animals,
machines, and infrastructures become the condition of identity itself.

(Introduction to the cyborg → shift to companion species)

  </p>Where in your own interaction did you become a cyborg? And where did the
interface shape what “being human” or “being machine” meant? Watching this
talk with your drift in mind can turn the game into an inquiry about how
technologies produce the identities they seem to measure.
