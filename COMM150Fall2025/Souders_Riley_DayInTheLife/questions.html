    <h1>Day in the Life of a UNC Sophomore</h1>
    <h2>By: Riley Souders</h2>
    <div class="question question-1">
        It's Friday night, and your friends are going out. They want you to come along! They say you deserve it because you’ve had a long week. You were planning on going to a networking event tomorrow at 7 am. This event could help land you an internship next semester. Your friends always stay out late into the wee hours of the morning. Will you join them?
    </div>
    <div class="answer-choices question-1">
        <div id="question-1-choice-a">Join them</div>
        <div id="question-1-choice-b">Stay in</div>
    </div>
     <div class="question question-1a">
        You get back at 1 am. You needed to wake up at 6 am to make the event. Do you set your alarm or sleep in late?

    </div>
    <div class="question question-2">
        You currently have a 91 in your art history class, but you were hoping to receive an A, as this was an easy gen ed to knock out. Your professor gives an opportunity for extra credit if you visit the Ackland Art Museum and write a two-page paper on it. You have been so busy all week and have had no time to yourself to rest. Do you take your Saturday to do the extra credit, or do you make the day a self-care day and relax?
    </div>
    <div class="answer-choices question-2">
        <div id="question-2-choice-a">Do extra credit</div>
        <div id="question-2-choice-b">Take self-care day</div>
    </div>
     <div class="question question-3">
        You have a two-hour window between your classes in an otherwise busy day. Do you use the time to lift at the Student Rec Center or use the time to get Starbucks and get ahead on an Econ assignment?
    </div>
    <div class="answer-choices question-3">
        <div id="question-3-choice-a">Go to the SRC</div>
        <div id="question-3-choice-b">Go to Starbucks</div>
    </div>
     <div class="question question-3b">
        You get to Starbucks and see a friend you've been meaning to catch up with. Do you sit with them or sit alone?
    </div>
    <div class="answer-choices question-3b">
        <div id="question-3b-choice-a">Sit alone</div>
        <div id="question-3b-choice-b">Sit together</div>
    </div>
    <div class="question question-4">
        Your final for your statistics class is tomorrow at 10:30 am. Although you feel mostly prepared, there are still some concepts that you struggle with. Do you go to sleep early, assuming that you know enough to get a decent grade, or do you stay up super late cramming?
    </div>
    <div class="answer-choices question-4">
        <div id="question-4-choice-a">Go to sleep now</div>

    <div class="question question-5">
        You wake up for class feeling achy and are coughing a lot. Your 8 am is very strict on attendance and gives a 1-point penalty for any absence, excused or not. You have already missed class twice. Will you go to class?

        You get to class, and your professor is giving a very important lecture. You start feeling even worse to the point you can barely focus. Do you stay for the important lecture or excuse yourself and go to Campus Health?

    <div class="question question-6">
        It's the last day of class in the semester, and you plan on driving home tomorrow to hang out with your high school friends who you haven’t seen in a while. However, a service club that you hold leadership in reschedules its meeting to the same day you plan on going home. Do you stay for the meeting and miss the event with your friends or go home and miss the meeting?

    </div>
    <div class="question question-7">
        You’re planning your classes for next semester. You have the option to stick to 15 credits and stay on pace with your degree plan, or add another 3-credit class and knock out your last gen ed, lightening your course load for junior and senior year. Do you add the gen ed?

    </div>
    <div class="question question-8">
        You're living on your own next semester, and your parents will contribute toward your food budgeting. You can either get an on campus meal plan, allowing you to socialize more at the dining halls, or you can use the money to buy groceries and cook your own healthy meals at home. Do you get the meal plan, risking eating unhealthier, or make meals with fresh ingredients, risking socialization with your friends?
