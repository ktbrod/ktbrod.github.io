      <h1>System Report: Attention Route</h1>

      <p>
        From the system’s side, your routine was processed as a sequence of clicks, dwell
        times, and responses to a single suggestion.
      </p>

      <p>
        Your first action, your reaction to the “You might like this” moment, and the total
        time you spent here can all be modeled as engagement. Each step becomes a data point
        that helps the system refine what to surface next.
      </p>

      <p>
        Your intention matters, but it’s only visible when you state it directly. Everything
        else is inferred from behavior. The boundary between “you” and “the machine” is drawn
        where your choices meet these predictions.
      </p>

      <p>
        When you clicked through this story, you weren’t just <em>using</em> the interface.
        You were also being measured, sorted, and gently steered by it.
